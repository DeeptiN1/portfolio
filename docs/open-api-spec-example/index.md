* The example API is a free REST API from [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) to get exercises by equipment type.
* The [Swagger parsers](https://github.com/peterhend/documentation-theme-jekyll/tree/547752cda66742c0497e8b76c3b9d3c6a19c1638/_includes/swagger_parsers) used are referenced from [Peter Henderson's solution](https://www.enigma.com/resources/blog/integrating-autogenerated-content-into-your-documentation-site-using-swagger-and-jekyll).
* Refer to the YAML file [here](https://github.com/DeeptiN1/portfolio/tree/main/_data/swagger/exercise_api.yaml).
