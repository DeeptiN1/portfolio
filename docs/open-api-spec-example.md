# OpenAPI spec integration using Swagger and Jekyll

I integrated autogenerated API documentation into this site using Swagger (OpenAPI specification) and Jekyll.

----------------------

### API documentation using OpenAPI specification
* The example API is a free REST API from [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb).
* The [Swagger parsers](https://github.com/peterhend/documentation-theme-jekyll/tree/547752cda66742c0497e8b76c3b9d3c6a19c1638/_includes/swagger_parsers) used are referenced from [Peter Henderson's solution](https://www.enigma.com/resources/blog/integrating-autogenerated-content-into-your-documentation-site-using-swagger-and-jekyll).
* Refer to the YAML file [here](https://github.com/DeeptiN1/portfolio/tree/main/_data/swagger/exercise_api.yaml).

### REST Endpoint
GET `/exercises/equipment/{type}`

### Summary 

{% include swagger_parsers/getattribute.md attribute="summary" %}

### Description

{% include swagger_parsers/getattribute.md attribute="description" %}

### Authorization Header parameters

{% include swagger_parsers/getauthheaders.md paramtype="header" %}

### Path parameters

{% include swagger_parsers/getparams.md paramtype="path" %}

### Query parameters

{% include swagger_parsers/getparams.md paramtype="query" %}

### Responses

{% include swagger_parsers/getresponses.md %}

### Content types:

{% include swagger_parsers/getattribute.md attribute="produces" type="list" %}

### Sample execution

Follow these steps to retrieve a valid API key to execute the API:
* Create an account on [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up).
* Sign in to the account.
* From the console, go to:
  `Apps → My Apps → default_application_<application-id> → Authorization → Application Key`
* Copy the API key.
* Use the API key in the header of the API request.

Following are examples of the API execution using Postman and the cURL command.

* **Postman** 

In Postman, enter the URL: `https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/equipment/assisted?limit=5&offset=2` and specify the API Key and its value under `Authorization`.

* **cURL**

In the cURL command below, substitute `<API_Key>` with the actual value.

`curl -X GET "https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/equipment/assisted?limit=5&offset=2" -H "accept: application/json" -H 'X-RapidAPI-Key: <API_Key> | python3 -m json.tool`
