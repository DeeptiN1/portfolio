# Memo
{: .no_toc }
The memo below is for all engineering managers working in a company that has developed a fictitious invoicing software called "SimpliCompense".

-------------------------

**TO**: All engineering managers working on SimpliCompense’s Inventory management product

**FROM**: Sheila Larkin, Director, Product Development

**DATE**: April 29, 2024

**SUBJECT**: Launch of SimpliCompense’s Inventory Management product

This memo informs all engineering managers working on SimpliCompense’s Inventory management product about an earlier launch date of SimpliCompense’s Inventory Management Product.

Upper management has requested the product’s launch with must-have features at an earlier date of September 22 to take advantage of online holiday season shopping opportunities in November and December.

In order to meet the revised deadline, the product team has included features with maximum revenue impact and removed auxiliary features from the previous feature list. We will share the new product requirements document with all engineering managers on Monday, May 6 and discuss the requirements in the engineering and product leadership meeting on Thursday, May 9.

We are aware that this initiative will impact development work and beta testing schedules. In light of the tight deadlines and increased workload on engineers reporting to you, we have requested engineering leaders from other verticals to lend their engineers for a duration of four months to contribute toward feature development efforts required for the launch of the inventory management product. We are confident that these additional efforts will lead to the product’s successful launch.
